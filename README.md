# Stupid Game — README

## Overview

Stupid Game is a deliberately silly, light‑hearted project created purely for fun. It doesn’t take itself seriously, and neither should you. Expect unpredictable mechanics, questionable design choices, and an experience that’s more chaotic than polished.

## Features

* **Ridiculous Gameplay:** Things happen for no logical reason. Buttons might do what they say… or not.
* **Random Events:** Every playthrough may throw new nonsense your way.
* **Questionable Physics:** Objects behave in ways that may or may not obey reality.
* **Minimal Plot:** The story is whatever you decide it is.

## Installation

1. Download the game files from the release page.
2. Extract the folder to any location on your system.
3. Run the main executable:

   * On Windows: `stupidgame.exe`
   * On macOS/Linux: run the included script or binary.

## How to Play

1. Launch the game.
2. Press **Start** (or any button, honestly—something will happen).
3. Move around using your keyboard or controller.
4. Interact with whatever you find. Results may vary.
5. Try to reach the goal… if it even exists.

## Controls

* **WASD / Arrow Keys:** Move
* **Space:** Jump (sometimes higher than expected)
* **E:** Interact
* **Esc:** Pause, if the game feels like cooperating

## Tips

* If the game behaves strangely, that’s normal.
* If you’re confused, that’s expected.
* If something breaks, just restart. It adds to the charm.

## Known Issues

* Objects may phase through the floor.
* Audio might randomly play or stop.
* The UI occasionally forgets it exists.
